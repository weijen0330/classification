    "- **P-Values** retain their same interpretation (probability of observing the relationship _by chance_), and can be used to confirm/reject the null hypothesis\n",

    "**Units** of the betas are more difficult to interpret. Each unit increase in $X$ is _associated with_ an increase in the **log odds** of the dependent variable $Y$. As you can see in the curve above, increases in log odds are **multiplicative** in nature. This means that a unit increase in $X$ corresponds to a **different** change in $Y$ depending on your **current value of $X$** (see how the **slope** of the curve changes). However, if we **exponentiate the beta value**, we can also describe proportional increase in the **odds** (not just the increase in _log odds_). Consider the following formulas for calculating the log odds for ${X}_{i}$ and ${X}_{i - 1}$ (a unit increase in $X$):\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the **linear relationship** in logit space, we can then easily calculate the **difference** in log odds between ${X}_{i}$ and ${X}_{i + 1}$ as $B_{1}$:\n",
